# The Benefits of Disrupting Social Media Platforms

## What's Subsocial?

> Subsocial is a platform that allows anyone to build decentralized social networks.

Subsocial allows its content creators to create censorship-resistant versions of todayâ€™s most used social networks such as Medium, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and more. It is built with IPFS (Interplanetary File System) for decentralized storage and Substrate, a modular framework written in the programming language Rust that prioritizes memory safety and performance. By using Substrate, the Subsocial network connects to the Polkadot and Kusama networks, enabling cross-chain interactions and shared security.

## Key Features

Subsocial offers several key features that enhance the decentralized social network experience:

- **Spaces**: Spaces in Subsocial are similar to channels on YouTube or accounts, pages, or groups on Facebook. They provide a dedicated place for users to share and organize their content within the Subsocial network.
- **CID Integration**: Subsocial integrates with IPFS to enable the creation of a CID (Content Identifier). The CID acts as directions to locate a file, making it easier to upload content to a space via a post. It ensures proof of ownership and control over published or monetized assets associated with a user's public key pair.

## Use Cases

Subsocial presents various compelling use cases for decentralized social networks:

- **Content Filtering and Customization**: Space owners in Subsocial can utilize the Subsocial SDK to filter and customize the content displayed within their space. This feature allows owners to curate the content and focus on providing the best experience to their followers.
- **Monetization and Social-Finance Primitives**: Creators on Subsocial have various monetization options, including subscriptions, selling or renting their space or posts, and tokenizing their space to distribute tokens to their followers. Additionally, Subsocial supports the deployment of smart contracts, enabling the utilization of social-finance primitives.

## Contributors & Investors

Early contributors helped Subsocial form by participating in crowdloans specific to the Polkadot & Kusama parachain ecosystem. Subsocial rewarded early investors by giving them a greater percentage of tokens and also received venture capital from multiple firms.
